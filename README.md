leaderboard tracker.

please note

this is not 100% accurate, sometimes you will see people appear in the channels who have been on the leaderboard for a while
this a problem because of the scraping usernames from leaderboard (ratelimits / proxy issues)

however for the most part it's pretty accurate

what the chanels can contain:

leaderboard-new - contains users who appear newly in the leaderboard (either getting the rank 10k+ or leaving the rank 10k)

leaderboard-1mil - users who newly appear on the leaderboard, with over 1mil value (includes random bot glitches where the user scraper fucks up)

leaderboard-unsure - contains users who newly appear on the leaderboard, which haven't been comped, haven't floated around the 10k rank and neither have 1mil+ value

leaderboard-compusd - users who sold items for usd, or got comped, or received comped items (if they went from 0 value to 4mil for example, it would go here not the 1mil+ channel)
